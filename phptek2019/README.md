# php[tek] 2019

php[tek] took a new approach and has curated tracks instead of an RFP process. This resulted in more coherent tracks, and my plan is to (mostly) attend a single track for all of a given day.

Plan is:
* Tuesday: Security
* Wednesday: Performance
* Thursday: Advanced PHP

Actual talks attended:
* Tuesday
  * 9am: traveling from airport
  * 10am: API Track: [Design First is better than API first](./api/design-first-api-first.md)
  * 11am: Security: [Password-Based Authentication Strategies](./security/password-based-authentication.md)
  * 1pm: API Track: [Authentication: The Token API Talk](./api/token.md)
  * 2pm: Security: [Access Control & Authorization](./security/access-control-authorization.md)
  * 3:30pm: Security: [Fortifying Your Defenses with Threat Modeling](./security/threat-modeling.md)
