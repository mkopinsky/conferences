# php[tek] 2019

php[tek] took a new approach and has curated tracks instead of an RFP process. This resulted in more coherent tracks, and my plan is to (mostly) attend a single track for all of a given day.

Plan is:
* Tuesday: Security
* Wednesday: Performance
* Thursday: Advanced PHP

Actual talks attended:

| Day | Time | Track | Talk |

| Tuesday |10am |API| [Design First is better than API first](./api/design-first-api-first.md)|
