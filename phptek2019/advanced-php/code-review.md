# Code Review

Slides by Steve Grunwell, Talk by Samantha Quinone

* Formal Code Review
    * Official Part of dev workflow
    * Dev -> Code Review -> Merge
    * Pair Programming
    * "Bug sweeps"
        * Usually after merge, going through things that changed that day/week
* Informal Code Review
* Catch Bugs
    * Second set of eyes
    * Catch egregious style things
        * Should be automated
* Facilitating Code Reviews
    * We try to be egalitarian, but power dynamics are prevalent!
        * Not just manager vs IC, also old vs. new, different demographics
    * Other things to consider
        * Code ownership - "Have someone from the payments team review this"
        * Learning opportunity for reviewer - e.g. X is looking to get better at testing
        * Learning opportunity for dev - e.g. first time implementing new pattern, have someone review who's most familiar with the pattern
    * Be mindful about who to assign to
